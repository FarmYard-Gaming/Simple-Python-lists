# Simple-Python-lists

This is just a small project I started in the middle of a Python lecture because I was so far ahead of everyone else. I liked where it was going so I uploaded it.

This is a menu-based program and it really isn't anything fancy. It's basically just here for lists. If that's what you need, welcome.

The program includes error handling but isn't fully working yet. This is a hobby project so I'll get to it eventually.
